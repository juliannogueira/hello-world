taped dream-catcher

I just had a deja-vu of this moment! Hopefully this is a good sign that something positive will emerge from this experience. I'm not sure how much I should write about myself, but here it goes. I am 21 years old, and this is my first tiny step in coding. I am excited and committed. I have one more semester until I graduate, but I turned away from a major decision that would have set my life in a very different direction. I hope it pays off.
